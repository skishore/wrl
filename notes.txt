Unless otherwise specified: all entities @ full health

List of relations:
  - Unknown
  - Scanned
  - Neutral
  - Friendly
  - Uncertain
    - Means we'll growl at it
    - If they don't respond: can switch to Dangerous or Hostile
    - Can we reach this state without seeing an entity?
      - e.g. based only on a scary sound?
      - maybe we want "Friendly" to take priority?
      - or: maybe we split status into a bitset
  - Dangerous
    - Means we'll run from it, but not attack
    - If they keep pursuing: may turn Hostile
  - Hostile

Current transitions:
  - Scan an unknown sound -> Scanned
  - Hear source call for help "for us" -> Friendly
    - Right now: it's "for us" if we're a Pidgey
    - Instead: match call sound against ours + friends
  - Attacked -> Hostile
  - Else, if we see entity:
    - Our predator -> Hostile
    - Other Pidgey -> Friendly
    - All else -> Neutral
  - We can do better!
